Drupal PHP CodeSniffer Ruleset
===

To install this PHP CodeSniffer ruleset on Ubuntu, simply copy the 'Drupal' folder to `/usr/share/php/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards`.

After that, simply run `phpcs -i` to confirm that your new ruleset is installed.

I don't expect to make any significant changes to this from the [original](https://github.com/Ishino/Drupal-PHP-CodeSniffer-ruleset) other than to add some documentation.
